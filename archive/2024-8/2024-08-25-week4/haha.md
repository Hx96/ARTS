Each browser has a limit to the maximum height of a div. This limit is not published so can differ between different browsers as well as different browser versions. At the time of writing, on Chrome v118 the maximum height was 32,000,000 pixels.


AG Grid.RowContainerHeightService: maxDivHeight = 32000000


rowBuffer=10
